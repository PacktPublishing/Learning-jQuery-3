# Learning jQuery 3 - Fifth Edition
This is the code repository for [Learning jQuery 3 - Fifth Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-jquery-3-fifth-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785882982), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
If you are a web developer and you want to create web applications that look good as well as being efficient, have rich user interfaces, and integrate seamlessly with any back end using AJAX, then this book is the ideal match for you. Weâ€™ll show you how you can integrate jQuery 3.0 into your web pages, avoid complex JavaScript code to create brilliant animation effects for your web applications, and create a flawless app with professional interoperability features.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
body {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
h1, h2, h3 {
  margin-bottom: .2em;
}
.poem {
  margin: 0 2em;
}
.highlight {
  background-color: #ccc;
  border: 1px solid #888;
  font-style: italic;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
  padding: 0.5em;
}
```

In order to run the example code demonstrated in this book, you need a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Microsoft Edge.

To experiment with the examples and to work on the chapter-ending exercises, you will also need the following:
* A basic text editor
* Web development tools for the browser, such as Chrome Developer Tools or Firebug (as described in the Using development tools section of Chapter 1, Getting Started)
* The full code package for each chapter, which includes a copy of the jQuery library (seen in the Downloading the example code section)

Additionally, to run some of the Ajax examples in Chapter 6, Sending Data with Ajax and
beyond, you will need Node.js.
